# Document Templates

To install LaTeX and all the packages needed to build the documents in this repository,
you can go the overkill route and issue:

```bash
$> sudo apt install texlive texlive-fonts-extra texlive-latex-extra texlive-xetex
```

(Note that this comes to roughly 2GB, much of which is contained in `texlive-fonts-extra`).
